# Java-Chat-App

I haven't coded in a few years and you know what they say, if you don't use it, you'll lose it. So, I figured I do something in Java. Since my teenage twin niece and nephew love hanging out with me, ok, so I bribed them to hang out with me. So what. üòÇ I asked them what would they like to see me make. Of course after I got past the dirty looks and mumbling that only teenagers give, they still didn't give me any ideas. üòÇ

So, after noticing that they are ALWAYS on their phones, I asked what if I was to create a messaging app? The face that they gave me, I couldn't see it. They never lifted heads up from their phones. üôÑü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I decided to just make the messaging app anyway.

So, here's the details of this project:

Create a simple messaging app for high school students and show them how to create themselves. And just to make things a bit interesting, I figured I'd do a secured version of the messaging app as well. Below are screenshots of the project and this will take you to the [REPOSITORY](https://github.com/bgleton1031/Java-Chat-App/blob/Unsecured-Messaging-App-Code/README.md) with the code that I've used for both secured and unsecured messaging app.

I've created seperate packages and classes to distinguish the difference between the secured and unsecured versions of the servers and the applications.

As you can see, I also have separate tabs indentifying which is which between the servers and the clients, secured and unsecured versions of it.

This is just a quick snippet of the code for the chat server.

I know if I was to spend a little more time with this, I would definitely improve the GUI and have it look so much better. Something else that I would improve on, is the input. It seems super robotic. I would make it more intuitive and make it move more smoothly. Obviously to make this mobile, I'll just have to put it on an SDK pacakage. That will make it work for the android phone. With a little bit of research and tweaking, I can get it to work on an iPhone.
